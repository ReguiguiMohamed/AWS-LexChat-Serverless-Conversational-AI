# AI Testing Suite Reflection

This document captures insights from a five-part banking chatbot testing suite.

## 1. Prompt Quality Assessment

- **Clarity** – The greeting and balance inquiry prompts were clear; the transfer and
  context-management prompts needed more explicit slot/confirmation examples.
- **Scope** – The fallback prompt was narrow, while the transaction prompt risked being
  overly broad without stated limits.
- **Progression** – Difficulty increased logically from greeting to multi-step transfers,
  though the jump to advanced context handling was abrupt.
- **Completeness** – Prompts could better specify error handling, authentication, and
  expected response formatting.

## 2. Testing Effectiveness

- **Coverage** – The suite exercises intent routing, slot management, confirmation logic,
  and basic error handling but lacks tests for persistence and scalability concerns.
- **Real-world Relevance** – Scenarios mirror common banking tasks yet omit compliance
  and security considerations present in production chatbots.
- **Discrimination** – Prompts differentiate beginner from intermediate skill levels;
  advanced reasoning (e.g., fraud detection) remains untested.
- **Bias Detection** – Examples assume a single user profile and English language,
  leaving regional or accessibility biases unexamined.

## 3. Educational Value

- **Learning Progression** – Concepts build sequentially, introducing intents, slots,
  confirmation, and fallback strategies.
- **Practical Application** – Skills transfer to other chatbot domains, especially those
  requiring transactional workflows.
- **Industry Alignment** – Prompts align with current serverless chatbot practices but
  could expand to cover monitoring and compliance.
- **Knowledge Gaps** – Underrepresented topics include localization, data retention, and
  security auditing.

## 4. Improvement Recommendations

| Prompt | Refinements | Additional Constraints | Alternative Scenario | Evaluation Criteria |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 1. Greeting | Clarify expected personalization fields | Require session attribute persistence | Multi-language greeting | Check presence of user name and locale |
| 2. Balance Inquiry | Specify account types and error messages | Validate numeric formatting | Add insufficient-funds case | Assert correct balance and errors |
| 3. Transfer | Outline confirmation flow in detail | Limit transfer amount to positive values | Scheduled transfers | Verify balance updates and confirmations |
| 4. Fallback | Define recovery strategies | Enforce neutral, helpful tone | Offer help-menu intent | Confirm suggested re-prompting |
| 5. Context Management | Detail session memory expectations | Cap session history length | Cross-session recall | Measure context retention accuracy |

## 5. Meta-Learning Insights

- **Process Efficiency** – Template-based event builders speed test creation.
- **Scalability** – The approach can adapt to other domains by swapping domain-specific
  intents and slots.
- **Version Control** – Iterate via small commits that pair new prompts with dedicated
  tests.
- **Success Metrics** – Track test pass rate, coverage of intents/slots, and alignment
  with real banking user stories.

## 6. Critical Analysis

- **Assumptions** – The suite assumes reliable authentication and stable account data.
- **Edge Cases** – Missing slot values or malformed amounts could break flows.
- **Context Dependencies** – Different LLMs may interpret confirmation or slot values
  inconsistently.
- **Ethical Considerations** – Testing should respect privacy and avoid reinforcing
  financial biases or exclusionary language.
